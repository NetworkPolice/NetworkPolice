# 👮‍♂️ NetworkPolice | Raul's Journey from law enforcement to network enforcement—building secure systems one subnet at a time.

Welcome to my digital beat. I'm Raul, a former police officer now patrolling the world of networking. My mission: Dive deep into the backbone of secure systems and build the skillset that keeps infrastructure resilient and responsive.

Some systems hum perfectly. Others need a tune-up and a tactical response.

I specialize in hands-on network configuration, firewall enforcement (Yes, I get to be a firefighter—of the TCP/IP kind), and VM-based system hosting. I approach every setup with discipline, attention to detail, and security-first thinking.

To sum it up: I'm here to learn, grow, and pave my way into cybersecurity and network engineering. One day, I’ll live in the cloud. Until then, it’s late nights, lights and sirens echoing through the city of packets. 

## 🚨 Certifications in Progress
- 🎓 Network+ (Studying)
- 🔐 Security+ (Next on the list!)

## 🔗 Tactical Divisions

- 🔐 [Firewall Division](https://networkpolice.github.io/NetworkPolice/firewall.html)  
  A command dashboard showcasing subnet enforcement logs and port access violations.

- 🧭 [DNS Division](https://networkpolice.github.io/NetworkPolice/dns.html)  
  Placeholder for simulated zone files, `dig` outputs, and DNS diagnostics.

- 📄 [Violations Division](https://networkpolice.github.io/NetworkPolice/violations.html) *(pending)*  
  Infractions table tracking ping sweeps, Telnet attempts, and suspicious access protocols.

## 🚀 Recent Project Highlights

- **DNS Division Deployment**  
  Created and deployed a DNS simulation page using Apache-hosted HTML. Managed repo syncing with Git, resolved branch conflicts, and applied rebase strategy for clean integration.

- **Repo Restoration & Git Strategy**  
  Recovered an unsynced Apache directory and re-linked it to GitHub. Navigated divergent branches, set credential authentication with tokens, and implemented `git pull --rebase` workflows for future-proof syncing.

- **Firewall Rules Integration**  
  Designed `firewall.html` to showcase subnet boundaries and rule enforcement logic, tying visuals into themed digital enforcement branding.
